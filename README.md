# FIFOVERIFICATION
This repository contains a comprehensive SystemVerilog testbench for verifying a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) memory module. The testbench includes:

Transaction Class: Defines data structures and constraints for FIFO operations, including read, write, and status flags.
Generator Class: Generates randomized transactions and sends them to the FIFO through a mailbox.
Driver Class: Drives the FIFO with read and write operations based on the generated transactions.
Monitor Class: Observes the FIFO's behavior and captures its state and data.
Scoreboard Class: Verifies the correctness of FIFO operations by comparing expected and actual data, tracking errors.
Environment Class: Orchestrates the testbench components, including setup, execution, and teardown of the test.
Testbench Module (tb): Instantiates the FIFO, connects it to the environment, and manages the simulation execution.
The testbench features modular components for efficient verification, error checking, and waveform dumping for detailed analysis.
