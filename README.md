# FIFOVERIFICATION
This repository contains a SystemVerilog testbench for a FIFO module, including a Transaction class for data and operations, a Generator for producing transactions, a Driver for interacting with the FIFO, a Monitor for observing behavior, and a Scoreboard for verification. It orchestrates testing via the Environment class and runs simulations.
