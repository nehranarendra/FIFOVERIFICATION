# FIFOVERIFICATION

FIFO Testbench
This repository provides a SystemVerilog testbench for verifying a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) memory module. The testbench includes various classes to generate, drive, monitor, and verify FIFO operations.

Components
Transaction Class: Defines data structures and constraints for FIFO operations (read, write, and status flags).

Generator Class: Produces randomized transactions and sends them to the FIFO.

Driver Class: Applies read and write operations to the FIFO based on generated transactions.

Monitor Class: Observes FIFO behavior and captures its state and data.

Scoreboard Class: Verifies FIFO operations by comparing expected and actual data, tracking errors.

Environment Class: Manages the testbench components, including setup, execution, and teardown.

Testbench Module (tb): Instantiates the FIFO, connects it to the environment, and controls the simulation.

Usage
Setup: Ensure you have a SystemVerilog simulator installed.

Compile: Compile the FIFO module and testbench files.

Run Simulation: Execute the simulation to run the testbench and observe results.
